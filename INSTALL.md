# Install
This series of notebooks were made for prototyping a solution for the user story (see README.md).

We use only python and basic libraries.

The Containerfile provided in conf directory has all the needed modules and versions. More than that, one
could use it containers like podman or singularity to build the environment and run in virtually any machine.

We strongly recommend that if you use container to reproduce these notebooks in your environment.

# Google Colab
This series of notebooks were developed completely in a on-premisses environment and wasn't tested outside.

However, it is very likely these notebooks will run nicely on Colab. Don't forget to uploading the toy dataset to a convenient 
place.
